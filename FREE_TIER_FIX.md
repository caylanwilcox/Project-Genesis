# Free Tier API Fix

## Problem
The dashboard was using the `/snapshot` endpoint which requires a paid Polygon.io plan. This caused the "No Market Data Available" error.

## Solution
Updated the data fetching to use **free tier compatible endpoints**:

### ✅ What Changed

**1. API Endpoints (Now Free Tier Compatible)**
- ❌ Removed: `/v2/snapshot` endpoint (requires paid plan)
- ✅ Added: `/v2/aggs/ticker/{symbol}/prev` (previous close - FREE)
- ✅ Added: `/v2/aggs/ticker/{symbol}/range` (aggregates - FREE)

**2. Rate Limit Protection**
- Sequential fetching with 3-second delays between tickers
- 30-second refresh interval (vs 10 seconds)
- Stays within 5 calls/minute free tier limit

**3. Data Strategy**
```
For each ticker:
1. Fetch previous close (baseline price)
2. Fetch recent 1-minute bars (current price)
3. Calculate change from previous close
4. Display with 15-minute delay (free tier)
```

## How It Works Now

### API Call Pattern
```
Ticker 1 (SPY):
  - Call 1: Previous close
  - Call 2: Recent aggregates
  - Wait 3 seconds

Ticker 2 (QQQ):
  - Call 3: Previous close
  - Call 4: Recent aggregates
  - Wait 3 seconds

Ticker 3 (IWM):
  - Call 5: Previous close
  - Call 6: Recent aggregates
  - Wait 3 seconds

Ticker 4 (VIX):
  - Call 7: Previous close
  - Call 8: Recent aggregates
  - Done! (9 seconds total)

Wait 30 seconds → Repeat
```

### Rate Limit Math
- **Free Tier**: 5 calls per minute
- **Our Usage**: 8 calls every 30 seconds = ~2.67 calls/min ✅
- **Result**: Well within limits!

## Expected Behavior

### Initial Load (First 9 seconds)
```
Loading Live Market Data...
Fetching real-time data from Polygon.io

[After ~3s]  SPY loaded
[After ~6s]  QQQ loaded
[After ~9s]  IWM loaded
[After ~12s] VIX loaded
```

### Dashboard Display
You should see:
- ✅ Real prices for SPY, QQQ, IWM, VIX
- ✅ "Data Source: Polygon.io" in status bar
- ✅ "Live Data ✓" indicator
- ✅ Prices update every 30 seconds
- ⚠️ Data is delayed 15 minutes (free tier limitation)

### Example Data
```
SPY: $653.02 +$2.35 (+0.36%)
QQQ: $385.50 -$1.20 (-0.31%)
IWM: $218.75 +$1.85 (+0.85%)
VIX: $14.25 -$0.35 (-2.40%)
```

## Testing Steps

**1. Restart your dev server:**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

**2. Open dashboard:**
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

**3. Watch the loading sequence:**
- You'll see "Loading Live Market Data..."
- Tickers will load one by one (takes ~12 seconds)
- Dashboard will display with real prices

**4. Verify data is real:**
- Compare SPY price with [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY)
- Note: Free tier has 15-minute delay, so exact match not expected
- Price should be within a few dollars of actual market price

**5. Check console (F12):**
- Should see successful API calls
- No "NOT_AUTHORIZED" errors
- No rate limit errors

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "No Market Data Available"

**Check browser console (F12):**

1. **If you see "NOT_AUTHORIZED":**
   - Your API key might be invalid
   - Double-check `.env.local` file
   - Verify key at https://polygon.io/dashboard/api-keys

2. **If you see "429 Too Many Requests":**
   - You're hitting rate limits
   - Increase refresh interval in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` line 47:
     ```typescript
     useMultiTickerData(SYMBOLS, true, 60000) // 60 seconds
     ```

3. **If you see "No previous close data":**
   - Ticker might not exist or be delisted
   - Try different ticker symbols
   - Check symbol on Polygon.io directly

4. **If data loads but shows 0 or weird numbers:**
   - Market might be closed (weekends, holidays)
   - Previous close data is from last trading day
   - This is expected behavior

### Market Closed

When markets are closed (nights/weekends), you'll see:
- Previous day's closing prices
- No live updates (because market isn't trading)
- Market status: "CLOSED" (red dot)

This is **normal behavior** - data will update when market opens.

### Data Delay

Free tier has **15-minute delay**:
- Prices won't match real-time market exactly
- Expect ~15 minute lag during market hours
- To get real-time data, upgrade to Starter plan ($29/mo)

## API Upgrade Options

### Current Plan (FREE)
- ✅ 5 API calls per minute
- ⚠️ 15-minute delayed data
- ✅ Basic aggregates
- ❌ No snapshots
- ❌ No real-time quotes

### Starter Plan ($29/month)
- ✅ 100 API calls per minute
- ✅ **Real-time data** (no delay)
- ✅ All endpoints including snapshots
- ✅ Full historical data
- ✅ WebSocket support

[Upgrade at polygon.io/pricing](https://polygon.io/pricing)

## Performance Notes

### Load Time
- **Initial load**: ~12 seconds (sequential loading)
- **Subsequent updates**: Happen in background every 30 seconds
- **No UI blocking**: Dashboard is responsive during loading

### Memory Usage
- Minimal - only stores current ticker data
- No historical data cached
- Lightweight state management

### CPU Usage
- Low - simple calculations
- No heavy processing
- Canvas rendering optimized

## Files Modified

1. **src/hooks/useMultiTickerData.ts**
   - Changed from snapshot to previous close + aggregates
   - Added sequential fetching with delays
   - Rate limit protection

2. **app/dashboard/page.tsx**
   - Changed refresh interval: 10s → 30s
   - Added comment explaining rate limit consideration

## Success Indicators

✅ Dashboard loads without errors
✅ All 4 tickers show data
✅ Prices are realistic market values
✅ Status bar shows "Polygon.io" and "Live Data ✓"
✅ Data updates every 30 seconds
✅ No console errors
✅ No rate limit warnings

## Next Steps

If everything works:
1. ✅ Dashboard is ready to use!
2. Consider upgrading to Starter plan for real-time data
3. Test during market hours for live updates
4. Monitor console for any API issues

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify API key in `.env.local`
3. Test API key directly: https://polygon.io/dashboard/api-keys
4. Try with just 1-2 tickers to reduce API calls
5. Check Polygon.io status page for outages
