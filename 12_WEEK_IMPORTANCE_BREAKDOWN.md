# 12-Week ML Implementation: Importance & Priority Breakdown
## What Matters Most Each Week

---

## Overview: Critical Path Analysis

This document breaks down the **importance** of each week in the 12-week ML implementation timeline. Understanding what matters most each week helps you:

1. **Prioritize resources** (time, money, focus)
2. **Identify critical milestones** (can't skip these)
3. **Understand dependencies** (what blocks future work)
4. **Make go/no-go decisions** (is this working? Should we continue?)

**Color Coding:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - System fails without this, no shortcuts allowed
- 🟡 **HIGH** - Major impact on accuracy/performance, avoid skipping
- 🟢 **MEDIUM** - Important but can be simplified or delayed
- ⚪ **LOW** - Nice-to-have, can skip if timeline is tight

---

## Week 1-2: Foundation & Data Pipeline

### **Week 1: Database & Infrastructure Setup**

**Importance: 🔴 CRITICAL (10/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters Most:
Everything else depends on having a working database. Without this foundation, you cannot:
- Store historical data for ML training
- Track predictions for accuracy measurement
- Cache features for fast inference
- Persist trained models
- Monitor system performance

#### What Makes This Week Critical:
1. **Database Schema Design** - Get this wrong, and you'll need painful migrations later
2. **TimescaleDB Setup** - 10x faster queries on time-series data (essential for backtesting)
3. **Data Integrity** - Proper indexes, constraints, partitioning determine future performance

#### Success Criteria:
✅ PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB running locally or on Railway
✅ All tables created with proper indexes
✅ Can insert 100K rows in <5 seconds
✅ Can query 1 year of data in <500ms

#### If You Skip This Week:
❌ **CANNOT PROCEED** - Everything else requires database

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Use Supabase (managed PostgreSQL) instead of self-hosting: **Saves 1 day**
- Skip Redis setup initially, add later: **Saves 0.5 days**
- **Minimum time: 3 days** (compressed from 5)

---

### **Week 2: Real-Time Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering**

**Importance: 🔴 CRITICAL (10/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters Most:
You're creating the **fuel** for your ML models. Without quality features:
- Models will have nothing to learn from
- Accuracy will be terrible (45-50% random guessing)
- System becomes useless

#### What Makes This Week Critical:
1. **Historical Data Collection** - Need 2+ years of data (~2 million rows)
2. **Feature Engineering** - 100+ features determine model intelligence
3. **Data Quality** - Garbage in = garbage out (missing bars, bad data = failed models)

#### Success Criteria:
✅ 2+ years of historical data stored (500K+ bars per ticker)
✅ No gaps in data (market holidays filled properly)
✅ 100+ features computed and stored
✅ Feature computation takes <5 minutes for 1 ticker

#### If You Skip This Week:
❌ **CANNOT PROCEED** - No data = no ML training possible

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Start with 1 year instead of 2 years: **Saves 1 day** (but reduces model accuracy by 5-10%)
- Reduce features to 50 instead of 100: **Saves 1 day** (but reduces accuracy by 3-5%)
- **Minimum time: 3 days** (compressed from 5)

#### Critical Decisions This Week:
- **How much historical data?** More = better models, but slower training
  - 1 year = 58% accuracy
  - 2 years = 63% accuracy ✅ **Recommended**
  - 5 years = 65% accuracy (diminishing returns)

---

## Week 3-4: ML Model Training - Phase 1 (SPY Priority)

### **Week 3: SPY Model Training (All Horizons)**

**Importance: 🔴 CRITICAL (10/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters Most:
This is your **proof of concept**. If SPY models fail, the entire approach is questionable:
- SPY is the most predictable ticker (highest liquidity, most institutional activity)
- If you can't achieve 60%+ accuracy on SPY, other tickers will be worse
- This week validates whether ML approach works at all

#### What Makes This Week Critical:
1. **First Real Models** - You'll see if 2 weeks of prep work paid off
2. **Accuracy Benchmark** - Sets expectations for other tickers
3. **Algorithm Validation** - Proves XGBoost/LSTM/Ensemble approach works
4. **Feature Importance** - Reveals which of your 100 features actually matter

#### Success Criteria:
✅ SPY 1-minute model achieves >60% test accuracy
✅ SPY 5-minute model achieves >63% test accuracy
✅ SPY daily model achieves >68% test accuracy
✅ Training completes without OOM (out of memory) errors
✅ Models can make predictions in <50ms

#### If You Skip This Week:
❌ **SEVERE RISK** - No validation that ML approach works
⚠️ Could continue with other tickers, but you're flying blind

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Train only 1m, 5m, 1h horizons (skip 15m, 4h, 1d): **Saves 2 days**
- Use only XGBoost, skip LSTM: **Saves 1.5 days**
- Skip hyperparameter optimization: **Saves 1 day** (but reduces accuracy by 3-5%)
- **Minimum time: 2 days** (compressed from 5, but risky)

#### GO/NO-GO Decision Point:
**If SPY models achieve <55% accuracy:**
- ❌ **STOP** - Something is fundamentally wrong
- Possible issues:
  - Bad data quality (check for gaps, errors)
  - Poor feature engineering (review features)
  - Insufficient training data (collect more)
  - Overfitting (check train vs. test accuracy gap)
- **Fix root cause before continuing to other tickers**

**If SPY models achieve 55-60% accuracy:**
- ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Marginal results
- Consider adding more features or data
- May work better on other tickers (QQQ has stronger trends)

**If SPY models achieve 60-70% accuracy:**
- ✅ **PROCEED CONFIDENTLY** - On track for success
- Continue to Week 4 backtesting

**If SPY models achieve >70% accuracy:**
- 🎉 **EXCEPTIONAL** - Likely overfitting, validate carefully
- Check for data leakage (future data in features)
- Verify on out-of-sample data

---

### **Week 4: Model Deployment & Backtesting (SPY)**

**Importance: 🟡 HIGH (8/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters:
Backtesting reveals if models work **in practice**, not just in theory:
- 65% accuracy sounds good, but does it translate to profits?
- What's the Sharpe ratio? Max drawdown?
- How often do you get false signals?

#### What Makes This Week Important (Not Critical):
1. **Risk Assessment** - Understand worst-case scenarios (max drawdown)
2. **Strategy Validation** - Proves models can generate positive returns
3. **Deployment Practice** - Learn MLflow, API setup before scaling to 4 tickers
4. **Performance Baseline** - Benchmark for comparing other tickers

#### Success Criteria:
✅ Backtest shows positive returns (>10% annual return)
✅ Sharpe ratio >1.5 (risk-adjusted returns acceptable)
✅ Max drawdown <20% (risk manageable)
✅ Win rate >55% (more wins than losses)
✅ Models deployed to inference API successfully
✅ Frontend can fetch SPY predictions in <100ms

#### If You Skip This Week:
⚠️ **HIGH RISK** - You won't know if models actually work until live trading
- Can proceed to train other tickers
- **BUT**: Might build 96 models only to discover they don't generate profits

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Skip backtesting, trust test accuracy: **Saves 2 days** ⚠️ **NOT RECOMMENDED**
- Simplified backtesting (no stop loss/take profit): **Saves 1 day**
- Deploy to localhost instead of cloud: **Saves 1 day**
- **Minimum time: 2 days** (compressed from 4)

#### Key Insights This Week Provides:
- **If backtest Sharpe <1.0:** Models aren't good enough for real trading
- **If win rate <50%:** Models worse than coin flip, need improvement
- **If max drawdown >30%:** Too risky, need better risk management

---

## Week 5-6: ML Model Training - Phase 2 (QQQ)

### **Week 5: QQQ Model Training (All Horizons)**

**Importance: 🟡 HIGH (7/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters:
QQQ validation proves your approach **generalizes** beyond SPY:
- Different sector composition (tech-heavy vs. broad market)
- Higher volatility (bigger moves = more signal or more noise?)
- Tests if features work across different ETF characteristics

#### What Makes This Week Important:
1. **Generalization Test** - Proves you're not overfitting to SPY specifically
2. **Diversification** - 2 tickers better than 1 for portfolio strategies
3. **Momentum Patterns** - QQQ has stronger trends (may improve accuracy)

#### Success Criteria:
✅ QQQ models achieve within 3% of SPY accuracy (e.g., SPY=65%, QQQ=62%+)
✅ Training process smoother (learned from SPY experience)
✅ Feature importance similar to SPY (validates feature engineering)

#### If You Skip This Week:
⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK** - System still works with just SPY
- Can operate single-ticker system
- Miss diversification benefits
- Can always add QQQ later

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Reuse SPY hyperparameters: **Saves 1 day** (skip Optuna optimization)
- Train only 3 horizons instead of 6: **Saves 1.5 days**
- **Minimum time: 2.5 days** (compressed from 5)

#### Decision Point:
**If QQQ accuracy much worse than SPY (>5% gap):**
- Investigate why (different volatility regime? Need different features?)
- May need ticker-specific feature engineering

**If QQQ accuracy similar to SPY:**
- ✅ Validates approach, proceed confidently to IWM and UVXY

---

### **Week 6: QQQ Backtesting & Deployment**

**Importance: 🟢 MEDIUM (6/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters Less:
- You've already validated backtesting process with SPY
- QQQ deployment is mostly copy-paste from SPY
- Incremental value (going from 1 ticker to 2)

#### Success Criteria:
✅ QQQ backtest Sharpe ratio >1.3
✅ Deployed to production API
✅ Frontend shows both SPY and QQQ predictions

#### If You Skip This Week:
✅ **LOW RISK** - Can deploy QQQ models without backtesting
- Already validated approach with SPY
- QQQ can go live based on test accuracy alone

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Skip backtesting entirely: **Saves 2 days**
- Deploy alongside Week 7 (IWM): **Saves 1 day**
- **Minimum time: 1 day** (just deployment)

---

## Week 7-8: ML Model Training - Phase 3 (IWM)

### **Week 7: IWM Model Training**

**Importance: 🟢 MEDIUM (6/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters Less:
- Small-cap ETF (lower liquidity, harder to trade)
- Expected lower accuracy (58-70% vs. 62-74% for SPY)
- Portfolio diversification benefit is marginal (IWM often follows SPY)

#### Success Criteria:
✅ IWM models achieve >58% accuracy
✅ Correlation analysis shows IWM adds diversification value

#### If You Skip This Week:
✅ **LOW RISK** - SPY + QQQ already provides solid coverage
- Can focus on improving SPY/QQQ models instead
- Add IWM later if needed

#### Time Savings Possible:
- **Skip IWM entirely:** **Saves 8 days** (entire Week 7-8)
- Train only daily horizon (skip intraday): **Saves 3 days**
- **Alternative:** Replace IWM with DIA (Dow Jones) - easier to predict

---

### **Week 8: IWM Backtesting & Deployment**

**Importance: 🟢 MEDIUM (5/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters Least So Far:
- Third ticker has diminishing returns
- Portfolio already diversified with SPY + QQQ
- IWM lower liquidity makes it harder to trade profitably

#### If You Skip This Week:
✅ **VERY LOW RISK** - Operate with just SPY + QQQ
- Most traders focus on SPY/QQQ only
- Can add IWM in post-launch phase

---

## Week 9-10: ML Model Training - Phase 4 (UVXY) + Advanced Features

### **Week 9: UVXY Model Training (Volatility ETF)**

**Importance: ⚪ LOW (4/10) - **OPTIONAL**

#### Why This Week Has Low Importance:
- **UVXY is extremely difficult to predict** (volatility of volatility)
- Expected accuracy: 52-68% (barely better than coin flip)
- High time decay (loses value over time due to contango)
- Not recommended for directional trading (better as hedge)

#### Success Criteria:
✅ UVXY 1m-15m models achieve >60% accuracy
✅ If accuracy <55%, consider removing UVXY from system

#### If You Skip This Week:
✅ **NO RISK** - UVXY is optional
- Most successful trading systems avoid volatility ETFs
- **Recommendation: Skip UVXY, use time for improving SPY/QQQ**

#### Better Alternative:
- Replace UVXY with **DIA** (Dow Jones Industrial Average)
  - More predictable (blue-chip stocks)
  - Higher liquidity
  - Expected accuracy: 60-72% (similar to SPY)

---

### **Week 10: System Integration & Advanced Features**

**Importance: 🟡 HIGH (8/10)**

#### Why This Week Suddenly Becomes Important:
This week transforms individual models into a **coherent system**:
- Multi-horizon aggregation (combine 1m + 5m + 15m + 1h predictions)
- Market regime detection (bull vs. bear vs. choppy)
- Confidence calibration (ensure 70% confidence = 70% win rate)
- Signal quality scoring (filter out low-quality signals)

#### What Makes This Week Critical:
1. **Huge Accuracy Boost** - Ensemble predictions can add +5-10% accuracy
2. **Risk Management** - Regime detection prevents trading in choppy markets
3. **User Trust** - Calibrated probabilities make system trustworthy

#### Success Criteria:
✅ Multi-horizon ensemble improves accuracy by >3%
✅ Regime detector identifies bull/bear markets correctly >80% of time
✅ Calibration curves show predicted probability ≈ actual win rate
✅ Signal quality filter reduces false signals by >30%

#### If You Skip This Week:
⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK** - System still works but accuracy suffers
- Can deploy individual models without ensemble
- Miss major accuracy improvements
- Users see more false signals

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Skip regime detection: **Saves 1 day**
- Skip calibration: **Saves 1 day** (but hurts user trust)
- **Minimum time: 2 days** (ensemble + signal filtering only)

#### Key Insight:
**This week often provides bigger accuracy gains than adding more tickers!**
- Ensemble of 3 models on SPY > 6 separate models on 4 tickers

## Week 11: Feedback Loop, Monitoring & Optimization

**Importance: 🔴 CRITICAL (9/10)**

#### Why This Week Is More Important Than It Seems:
Without feedback loops, your system **gets worse over time**:
- Markets change (what worked in 2023 fails in 2025)
- Models degrade (accuracy drops from 65% to 50% over 6 months)
- You never know if predictions are accurate until you track them

#### What Makes This Week Critical:
1. **Prediction Tracking** - Compare predictions vs. actual outcomes
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Alert when accuracy drops below threshold
3. **Auto-Retraining** - Trigger model updates when performance degrades
4. **Accountability** - Know which models work and which don't

#### Success Criteria:
✅ System automatically checks expired predictions every 5 minutes
✅ Rolling accuracy calculated for last 100 predictions
✅ Alerts triggered if accuracy drops below 55%
✅ Weekly retraining scheduled for Sunday 2am
✅ Performance dashboard shows live metrics (Grafana or custom)

#### If You Skip This Week:
❌ **SEVERE LONG-TERM RISK** - System degrades silently
- Models become stale within 3-6 months
- You won't notice until you lose money
- **No way to improve** (no data on what's working)

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Manual prediction checking instead of automated: **Saves 2 days** ⚠️ Not sustainable
- Skip auto-retraining, retrain manually: **Saves 1 day**
- **Minimum time: 2 days** (tracking + alerts only)

#### Real-World Example:
**Without feedback loops:**
- Month 1: 65% accuracy
- Month 3: 58% accuracy (market regime changed)
- Month 6: 51% accuracy (models completely stale)
- **You never noticed until it's too late**

**With feedback loops:**
- Month 1: 65% accuracy
- Month 2: Alert! Accuracy dropped to 58% → Auto-retrain triggered
- Month 3: Back to 64% accuracy (models adapted)
- **System self-heals**

---

## Week 12: Production Deployment, Testing & Documentation

**Importance: 🟡 HIGH (7/10)**

#### Why This Week Matters:
Transforms localhost prototype into **production-ready system**:
- Deploy to cloud (accessible 24/7)
- Load testing (ensure it handles multiple users)
- End-to-end testing (catch bugs before users do)
- Documentation (so you remember how it works in 6 months)

#### What Makes This Week Important:
1. **Reliability** - Can't run production system on your laptop
2. **Performance** - Ensure <100ms latency under load
3. **Security** - Proper authentication, rate limiting, secrets management
4. **Maintainability** - Documentation for future you

#### Success Criteria:
✅ Deployed to Railway/Render/AWS with 99%+ uptime
✅ Load test: 100 concurrent users, <100ms p95 latency
✅ SSL/TLS certificates configured
✅ Authentication working (JWT tokens)
✅ API documentation complete (Swagger/OpenAPI)
✅ Operational runbook written

#### If You Skip This Week:
⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK** - Can run on localhost temporarily
- Good for solo development
- **Can't share with users or run 24/7**
- Need to deploy eventually anyway

#### Time Savings Possible:
- Deploy to Railway (1-click deploy): **Saves 2 days** vs. AWS manual setup
- Skip load testing: **Saves 1 day** ⚠️ May have performance issues
- Minimal documentation: **Saves 1 day**
- **Minimum time: 2 days** (basic deployment + testing)
