## Calculation Details

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
```javascript
Period: 14 bars
Formula:
  1. Calculate gains/losses over 14 periods
  2. avgGain = sum(gains) / 14
  3. avgLoss = sum(losses) / 14
  4. RS = avgGain / avgLoss
  5. RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Interpretation:
  > 70: Overbought (potential sell signal)
  < 30: Oversold (potential buy signal)
  40-60: Neutral
```

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
```javascript
Fast EMA: 12 periods
Slow EMA: 26 periods
Formula:
  1. EMA12 = average of last 12 closes
  2. EMA26 = average of last 26 closes
  3. MACD = EMA12 - EMA26

Interpretation:
  MACD > 0: Bullish Cross
  MACD < 0: Bearish Cross
  MACD ≈ 0: Neutral
```

### Trend Detection
```javascript
Period: 20 bars
Formula:
  1. SMA20 = average of last 20 closes
  2. currentPrice = latest close
  3. change% = ((current - SMA20) / SMA20) × 100

Interpretation:
  > +2%: Strong Bullish
  > +0.5%: Bullish
  -0.5% to +0.5%: Neutral
  < -0.5%: Bearish
  < -2%: Strong Bearish
```

### Signal Score
```javascript
Base Score: 50 (neutral)

RSI Contribution (30 points):
  - RSI < 30: +15 (oversold = bullish)
  - RSI > 70: -15 (overbought = bearish)
  - RSI 40-60: +5 (neutral zone)

MACD Contribution (25 points):
  - Bullish Cross: +12
  - Bearish Cross: -12

Trend Contribution (25 points):
  - Strong Bullish: +12
  - Bullish: +8
  - Strong Bearish: -12
  - Bearish: -8

Price Change Contribution (20 points):
  - Change > +1%: +10
  - Change > +0.3%: +5
  - Change < -1%: -10
  - Change < -0.3%: -5

Final Signal:
  Score ≥ 80: STRONG BUY
  Score ≥ 65: BUY
  Score ≤ 35: SELL
  Score ≤ 20: STRONG SELL
  Otherwise: NEUTRAL

Confidence = min(95, max(25, score))
```
