---

### **WEEK 7-8: ML Model Training - Phase 3 (IWM) (Days 31-40)**

#### **Week 7: IWM Model Training**

**Day 31-35: IWM Models (All Horizons)**
- IWM characteristics:
  - Small-cap ETF (Russell 2000)
  - Lower liquidity than SPY/QQQ (wider spreads)
  - Higher volatility (±1-2% daily moves)
  - More prone to false breakouts
  - **Expected accuracy:** Slightly lower (58-70% vs. 62-74%)

---

### **WEEK 9-10: ML Model Training - Phase 4 (UVXY) + Advanced Features (Days 41-50)**

#### **Week 9: UVXY Model Training (Volatility ETF)**

**Day 41-45: UVXY Models**

**UVXY Special Considerations:**
- **Volatility ETF** (not equity ETF like others)
- Inverse correlation with SPY/QQQ (goes up when market falls)
- Extreme volatility (±5-15% daily moves)
- Time decay (loses value over time due to contango)
- Mean-reverting behavior (different from trend-following)

**Training Adjustments:**
- **Different features needed:**
  - VIX level (primary driver)
  - SPY/QQQ directional change (inverse correlation)
  - Market regime (risk-on vs. risk-off)
  - Futures term structure (contango/backwardation)
- **Different algorithms:**
  - Less focus on trend (Transformers less effective)
  - More focus on mean reversion (Random Forest + XGBoost)
  - Shorter horizons perform better (1m, 5m, 15m)
  - 4h and 1d models may be less accurate

**Expected Accuracy:**
- 1m-15m: 60-68% (reasonable)
- 1h-4h: 55-63% (challenging)
- 1d: 52-60% (very difficult due to time decay)

**Day 44-45: UVXY Ensemble Strategy**
- Create special meta-ensemble that incorporates SPY predictions:
  - If SPY predicts "strong down" → UVXY likely "up"
  - If SPY predicts "strong up" → UVXY likely "down"
  - Use SPY confidence as weight in UVXY prediction

#### **Week 10: System Integration & Advanced Features**

**Day 46-47: Multi-Horizon Prediction Aggregation**
- Build "Signal Strength Score" combining all horizons:
  ```python
  def calculate_signal_strength(predictions):
      # Weight longer horizons more heavily
      weights = {
          "1m": 0.05,
          "5m": 0.10,
          "15m": 0.15,
          "1h": 0.25,
          "4h": 0.25,
          "1d": 0.20
      }

      strength = 0
      for horizon, pred in predictions.items():
          direction_multiplier = 1 if pred['direction'] == 'long' else -1
          strength += weights[horizon] * pred['probability'] * direction_multiplier

      return strength  # Range: -1 (strong short) to +1 (strong long)
  ```

**Day 48: Regime Detection System**
- Train separate model to detect market regime:
  - **Bull Market:** SPY > 50-day MA, low VIX
  - **Bear Market:** SPY < 50-day MA, high VIX
  - **Choppy/Range-bound:** Sideways, medium VIX
- Adjust model selection based on regime:
  - Bull: Use momentum-focused models (LSTM, Transformer)
  - Bear: Use mean-reversion models (Random Forest)
  - Choppy: Use ensemble with equal weights

**Day 49-50: Confidence Calibration**
- Analyze prediction calibration:
  - When model says 70% confidence, does it win 70% of the time?
  - If not, apply Platt scaling or isotonic regression to calibrate
- Build calibration curves for each model
- Retrain meta-ensembles with calibrated probabilities

---

### **WEEK 11: Feedback Loop, Monitoring & Optimization (Days 51-55)**

**Day 51-52: Prediction Tracking System**

  - If latency exceeds 200ms → Slack alert
  - If API errors exceed 5% → Pagerduty alert

**Day 54: Automatic Retraining Triggers**
- Build logic to automatically queue models for retraining:
  ```python
  if current_accuracy < 0.55 and trend_declining:
      queue_for_retraining(model_version, priority='high')

  if days_since_last_training > 30:
      queue_for_retraining(model_version, priority='medium')

  if new_market_regime_detected():
      queue_for_retraining(model_version, priority='high')
  ```
- Set up weekly scheduled retraining (every Sunday at 2am)

**Day 55: Signal Filtering & Risk Management**
- Implement filters to reduce false signals:
  - Only show signals with >65% confidence
  - Require 2+ horizons agreeing on direction
  - Skip signals during low liquidity periods (first/last 15min of day)
  - Skip signals during major news events (Fed announcements, earnings)
- Build "Signal Quality Score":
  ```
  Quality = (confidence × 0.4) + (horizon_agreement × 0.3) + (model_performance × 0.3)
  ```
  - Only trade signals with Quality Score > 0.70

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning

### Risk 1: Models Don't Meet Accuracy Targets
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Start with SPY (most predictable) to validate approach
- If SPY models underperform (<60% accuracy), adjust features before training other tickers
- Consider adding alternative data (social sentiment, options flow)
- Extend training data to 5 years instead of 2 years
- **Contingency Time:** +2 weeks

### Risk 2: Polygon.io API Rate Limits Exceeded
**Likelihood:** Low (with Starter plan)
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor API usage continuously
- Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
- Cache historical data aggressively
- Upgrade to Developer plan ($99/month) if needed
- **Contingency Cost:** +$70/month

### Risk 3: Compute Resources Insufficient
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Start with smaller models (fewer parameters)
- Use cloud spot instances for training (60% cheaper)
- Train models sequentially if parallel training causes OOM errors
- **Contingency Time:** +1 week (slower training)

### Risk 4: UVXY Models Perform Poorly
**Likelihood:** High (expected)
**Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- UVXY is inherently difficult to predict
- If models don't meet targets, consider removing UVXY from system
- Alternatively, only use UVXY for hedging (not directional trading)
- Replace UVXY with DIA (Dow Jones ETF) if needed
- **Contingency:** No time impact (UVXY optional)

### Risk 5: Real-World Performance Deviates from Backtest
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Use walk-forward validation (not simple train/test split)
- Test on out-of-sample data from 2025 (not included in training)
- Paper trade for 2 weeks before live trading
- Implement circuit breakers (stop trading if drawdown >10%)
- **Contingency:** +2 weeks for paper trading validation

## Conclusion

This 12-week timeline provides a realistic, detailed roadmap for implementing ML-enhanced trading signals for your 4-ticker system. The phased approach (SPY → QQQ → IWM → UVXY) allows for learning and iteration, reducing risk of catastrophic failures.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Secure Polygon.io Starter plan before Day 1
2. Allocate 2+ weeks for historical data collection before training starts
3. Validate SPY models thoroughly before moving to other tickers
4. Monitor performance continuously and be ready to adjust
5. Don't skip backtesting—it's critical for risk management

**Expected Outcome:** A production-ready, self-learning trading system that provides probabilistic predictions with 60-76% accuracy across multiple timeframes, significantly outperforming traditional indicator-based approaches.
